All you really need to know, written from the perspective of a non-web-developer.<p>

- run "npm run dev" to test locally.<br>
  The console output will include a link to debug at http://localhost:5173/<br>
  Updates to code should immediately be visible in UI.

- run "npm run build" to build release code.<br>
  What this does is populate your 'dist' folder with your build results, a new web root for publishing.<br>
It also throws your javascript into a blender in the process.<br>
   
- run "npm install"<br>
It's possible to do this adhoc and may be relevant when updating package dependencies.<br><p>

I enjoyed using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and find it quite elegant and easy to use.
