All you really need to know, written from the perspective of a non-web-developer<p>

- run "npm run dev" to test locally<br>
  The console output will include a link to debug at http://localhost:5173/<br>
  Updates to code will immediately be visible in UI

- run "npm run build" to build release code<br>
  some sort of "javascript compilation magic" happens and your 'dist' folder is now the web root for static hosting.<br>
  mangled beyond belief javascript is your deliverable! That's "totally normal"<br>

- run "npm install"<br>
It's possible to do this adhoc and may be relevant when updating package dependencies.<br>
